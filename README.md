# ML-Projects
Hi, I’m Sahil Dogra!
After a decade in India’s education sector: spanning grassroots work to policy-making; I transitioned into tech and began building strong foundations in machine learning, data analytics, and AI.
This repository showcases the projects I’ve built while learning and practicing ML. Each project demonstrates how theoretical concepts translate into practical applications.A collection of machine learning projects covering regression, classification, clustering, recommendation systems, and neural networks.
